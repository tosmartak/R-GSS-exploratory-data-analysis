# [General Social Survey Statistical Analysis Using R](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/tosmartak/R-GSS-exploratory-data-analysis/blob/R-GSS-exploratory-data-analysis/stat_inf_project.html)
This work is an exploratory data analysis on General Social Survey data, with statistical inferences and visualization using the R language.

## About the Project
The GSS survey is an in-person interview conducted face-to-face by NORC at the University of Chicago, with a target population of adults (18+) living in United States households. Respondents are randomly sampled from a mix of urban, suburban, and rural geographic areas, and participation is strictly voluntary.
The research tried to find the relationship between race, age and perception of each category as a unique element towards premarital sex. Sexual behaviors of adolescents and youth have always been categorized as one of the main health priorities of a society because of high prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and unwanted pregnancies. Drawing inference from the GSS data, this work would help to strengthen understanding on the race and age of the population that are more prone to these diseases, based on their perception towards premarital sex, believing it would give a better insight to justify the belief of most people and also guide adolescent and youth health interventions.
